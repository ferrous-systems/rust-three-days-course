= Exercise The Option and Result Type and URL parsing

In this exercise, you will learn
* how to handle errors using the `Result`-type.
* how to use the `Option`-type.
* how to read a file line by line.
* how to count the number of lines in a file.


Both types are similar in the way, that they can have two types of values, and
depending on what those values are, the program continues in a different way.

The Option Type can have the variant `Some(<some other type>)` or `None`.
It is used, when you have to handle optional values, for example if you want to
be able to leave a field of a struct empty, go assign the option type to it.
If the field has a value, it is `Some(<value>)`, if it is empty, it is `None`.

The variants of the Result type are `Ok()` and `Err(e)`. It is used to handle errors.
If an operation was successful, `Ok()` is returned. `Ok()` can be empty or have a
return value. `Err(e)` contains an error message that can be printed.

# `match`

Both types can be used with the `match` keyword. The received value is matched on patterns, each leads to the execution of a different expression.

---
match VALUE {
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
    PATTERN => EXPRESSION,
}

== Tasks

* Find out, what type the variable f is. Either your IDE shows you, or you can assign a random type to the variable, and run the program.
* Match the two possible patterns, `Ok(file)` and `Err(e)` to an an appropriate expression, for example: `println!("File opened")` and `println!("Error: {}", e)`
* To use the content of the file, bind the `match` statement to a variable. Read the content of the file into a buffer and then into a `String`.
* Print the entire content of the file.
* Print the number of lines the file contains.
* Print the content of the file line by line. The `lines()`- method returns the `Result`-Type, use it.
* Use the `Option`- type to filter out the empty lines, and only print the the others.

== Help (wip)

3. If `match` is bound to a variable, both arms of the tree have to have the same type, except if one has a `continue` statement.
