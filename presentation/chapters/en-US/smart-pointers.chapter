# Special Pointers in Rust
[Table of Contents](toc/english.html)

---

Rust offers several special pointers to handle different scenarios.

They all have something in common: They are managed by ownership.

---

## `std::rc::Rc<T>`

Runtime reference counted within a thread.

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/smart-pointers/1.rs" data-trim="hljs rust" class="lang-rust"></code></pre>

---

## Semantics

-   `Rc` is a handle on the contained data
-   The handle can be cloned
-   If the last handle drops, drop the data as well
-   `Rc<T>` implements `Deref<Target=T>`

---

## `std::rc::Weak<T>`

Weak pointer to data.

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/smart-pointers/2.rs" data-trim="hljs rust" class="lang-rust"></code></pre>

---

## Semantics

-   Similar to `Rc`, however the existence of the data is not guaranteed
-   Single Threaded: The data is guaranteed to be available over the time of an operation
-   Is *not* automatically dereferenced
-   `Rc` circles are memory leaks, weak pointers prevent that

---

## Use

-   Frequently used in data structures that require complex cross references
-   Higher runtime costs for more flexibility

---

## `std::sync::Arc<T>`

A more expensive `Rc` which works across thread boundaries since an atomic counter is used for incrementing.

---

## Remark

Do not use `Arc` on a hunch. `rustc` rejects code using `Rc` over thread boundaries.

---

## `std::borrow::Cow`

-   Copy-on-write
-   Abstracts over Borrowing and Ownership
-   Clones Data only when necessary
