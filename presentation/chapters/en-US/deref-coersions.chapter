# Deref-Conversions

## Motivation

Why does the following work?

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/deref-coersions/1.rs" data-trim="hljs rust" class="lang-rust"></code></pre>

Box doesn't have a field named "x"!

## Auto-Dereferencing

Rust automatically dereferences in certain cases. Like everything else, it must be explicitly requested: 

-   Through a call or field access using the `.` operator
-   By explicitly dereferencing through `*`
-   When borrowing through `&`
-   This sometimes leads to the ugly `&*`-Pattern

---

This makes wrapper types very ergonomic and easy to use!

---

Dereferencing is described by the `Deref` and `DerefMut`-Traits.

<pre><code data-source="chapters/shared/code/deref-coersions/2.rs" data-trim="hljs rust"></code></pre>

This call is introduced when dereferencing is requested.

## Important deref behaviours

-   String -&gt; &str
-   Vec<T> -&gt; &\[T\]

Functions that don't modify the lengths of a String or a Vector  should accept a slice instead. The memory layout is chosen so that this is *cost free*.
