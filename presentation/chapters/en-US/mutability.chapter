# Mutability

---

Modern programming languages differ in their attitude towards data mutability.

Where does Rust land?

---

## An Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let answer = 42;
    answer = 32;
}
```

---

## Correct

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut answer = 42;
    answer = 32;
}
```

---

In Rust data mutability must be declared.

Mutability is always apparent from reading the code.

---

Mutability is fundamental to Rust and is a common consideration.
